# DataAnalysis
Data Analysis is the process of transforming data to get useful information.

# Data Analysis Process

It consists of five steps:

# Step 1: Asking Question

This is the initial phase, where we define the questions that we want to address through data analysis.

e.g., Which features have strong correlations?

# Step 2: Data Wrangling

Data wrangling is also called munging. It consists of three steps.

Gathering Data through APIs, databases, CSV files, and web scraping.
Assessing data to understand data is like finding the shape and information of data.
Cleaning of the data is used to remove duplicate values or replace missing values with the mean.
# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

It is a process where we can perform EDA to understand the characteristics of data and identify patterns.

# Step 4: Drawing Conclusions

After conducting EDA, we draw conclusions based on the patterns and insights discovered in the previous step. It can involve statistical analysis techniques, and modeling to validate your findings and make informed decisions.

# Step 5: Communicating Results

The final step involves effectively communicating the results of your analysis to relevant stakeholders. This may include creating reports, visualizations, or presentations that convey the key findings, insights, and recommendations derived from the data analysis process.
